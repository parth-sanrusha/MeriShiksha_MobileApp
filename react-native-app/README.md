# Merishiksha Mobile App

This is a React Native application converted from a React JS web app for Merishiksha.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Install Expo CLI**: Run `npm install -g expo-cli` to install Expo CLI globally.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the `react-native-app` folder and run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. **Start the App**: Use `npm start` to start the development server. You can then run the app on an Android or iOS simulator by pressing `a` for Android or `i` for iOS in the terminal, or scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on a physical device.

## Running on Specific Platforms
- For Android: `npm run android`
- For iOS: `npm run ios`

## Additional Notes
- Ensure you have the necessary setup for Android Studio or Xcode if you plan to run on simulators.
- The backend API endpoints are assumed to be the same as in the original web app. Ensure the server is running and accessible from your development environment or device.
